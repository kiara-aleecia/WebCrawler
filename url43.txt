Expeditions






 








 MBARI is strategically located in Moss Landing, California, at the head of the Monterey Canyon. Monterey Bay is our window to the world ocean, but from time to time, we take extended expeditions beyond California’s Central Coast. Our researchers also participate in collaborative expeditions hosted by academic organizations and governments around the world.
