Deep-Sea Search











The Deep-Sea Search page allows you to search for concept names that have been entered
into MBARI’s Deep-Sea Guide. These concepts can be biological, geological, or technical
in nature and can be specific (e.g., Embassichthys bathybius) or general (e.g., fish).
Results from this search give specific information about the concept searched for and
may include images, morphological descriptions, geographic, depth ranges, and occurrence data.

  The Deep-Sea Guide was created by MBARI’s video annotation laboratory. The descriptive and observational data within are representative highlights from our Video Annotation and Reference System (VARS) database. These unique VARS data are centrally managed as an institutional resource, resulting from decades of successful collaboration among scientists, engineers, and key technical staff at MBARI.
