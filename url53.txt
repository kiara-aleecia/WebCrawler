Overview
About EARTH
Workshops
Lesson Plans


 







 
 




 EARTH (Education and Research: Testing Hypotheses) is a curriculum and workshop series developed in collaboration between MBARI and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. EARTH lays new groundwork, providing educators with a means for integrating real-time data with existing educational standards and tested curriculum in an interactive and engaging way.At our annual EARTH Workshops educators work directly with scientists and engineers to understand and integrate their data sets into the lessons they develop. The majority of EARTH educators are middle and high school teachers, but we welcome kindergarten through college educators in both formal and informal settings, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.
