We investigated how its loss in a white-eyed mutant (W-E) alters the photoreceptor electrophysiological properties, opsin gene expression, and the behavior of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of green-sensitive photoreceptors in W-E cockroaches gave reduced membrane capacitance, absolute sensitivity to light, and light-induced currents. Decreased low-pass filtering increased voltage-bump amplitudes in W-E photoreceptors. Intracellular recordings showed that angular sensitivity of W-E photoreceptors had two distinct components: a large narrow component with the same acceptance angle as wild type, plus a relatively small wide component. Information processing was evaluated using Gaussian white-noise modulated light stimulation. In bright light, W-E photoreceptors demonstrated higher signal gain and signal power than wild-type photoreceptors. Expression levels of the primary UV- and green-sensitive opsins were lower and the secondary green-sensitive opsin significantly higher in W-E than in wild-type retinae. In behavioral experiments, W-E cockroaches were significantly less active in dim green light, consistent with the relatively low light sensitivity of their photoreceptors. Overall, these differences can be related to the loss of screening pigment function and to a compensatory decrease in the rhabdomere size in W-E retinae.
