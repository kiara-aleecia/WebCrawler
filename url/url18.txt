Abstract
Many species of stomatopod crustaceans have multiple spectral classes of photoreceptors in their retinas. Behavioral evidence also indicates that stomatopods are capable of discriminating objects by their spectral differences alone. Most animals use only two to four different types of photoreceptors in their color vision systems, typically with broad sensitivity functions, but the stomatopods apparently include eight or more narrowband photoreceptor classes for color recognition. It is also known that stomatopods use several colored body regions in social interactions. To examine why stomatopods may be so ‘concerned’ with color, we measured the absorption spectra of visual pigments and intrarhabdomal filters, and the reflectance spectra from different parts of the bodies of several individuals of the gonodactyloid stomatopod species, Gonodactylus smithii. We then applied a model of multiple dichromatic channels for color encoding to examine whether the finely tuned color vision was specifically co-evolved with their complex color signals. Although the eye design of stomatopods seems suitable for detecting color signals of their own, the detection of color signals from other animals, such as reef fishes, can be enhanced as well. Color vision in G. smithii is therefore not exclusively adapted to detect its own color signals, but the spectral tuning of some photoreceptors (e.g. midband Rows 2 and 3) enhances the contrast of certain color signals to a large enough degree to make co-evolution between color vision and these rather specific color signals likely.
