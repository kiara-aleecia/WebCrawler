• Use these formats for best results: Smith or J Smith
• Use a comma to separate multiple people: J Smith, RL Jones, Macarthur

Tips for preparing a search:

Keep it simple - don't use too many different parameters.
Separate search groups with parentheses and Booleans. Note the Boolean sign must be in upper-case.

Example: (diode OR solid-state) AND laser [search contains "diode" or "solid-state" and laser]
Example: (photons AND downconversion) - pump [search contains both "photons" and "downconversion" but not "pump"]


Improve efficiency in your search by using wildcards.

Asterisk ( * ) -- Example: "elect*" retrieves documents containing "electron," "electronic," and "electricity"
Question mark (?) -- Example: "gr?y" retrieves documents containing "grey" or "gray"

Use quotation marks " " around specific phrases where you want the entire phrase only.
For best results, use the separate Authors field to search for author names.
Author name searching:

Use these formats for best results: Smith or J Smith
Use a comma to separate multiple people: J Smith, RL Jones, Macarthur
Note: Author names will be searched in the keywords field, also, but that may find papers where the person is mentioned, rather than papers they authored.

Abstract
Multispectral images of natural scenes were collected from both forests and coral reefs to represent typical, complex scenes that might be viewed by modern animals. Both reflectance spectra and modeled visual color signals in these scenes were decorrelated spectrally by principal-component analysis. Nearly 98% of the variance of reflectance spectra and color signals can be described by the first three principal components for both forest and coral reef scenes, which implies that three well-designed visual channels can recover almost all of the spectral information of natural scenes. A variety of natural illuminants affects color signals of forest scenes only slightly, but the variation in ambient irradiance spectra that is due to the absorption of light by water has dramatic influences on the spectral characteristics of coral reef scenes.
