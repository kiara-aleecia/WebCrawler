Tech Transfer

MBARI builds and transfers scalable technologies to assess, monitor, and predict ocean health.
As part of advancing our mission, MBARI scientists, engineers, and technicians develop novel technologies and original works of authorship. We prioritize the transfer of knowledge gained, solutions devised, and technology developed to other communities. We seek to build mutually beneficial relationships with our partners and provide responsive, technology transfer options.
