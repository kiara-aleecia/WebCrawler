Media FAQ 



 






Can I get photos or video from MBARI to use with my story?

MBARI has a small team and limited resources to support the numerous requests we receive for use of our images and video. We prioritize news media and productions that focus specifically on MBARI research and technology. To help us evaluate your request, please submit a Media Request Form with details about your project. Please do not submit requests by phone or email. Requests are reviewed in the order in which they were submitted—additional outreach will not expedite a reply. MBARI may decline requests for projects that don’t align with our strategic education and outreach goals or if our team doesn’t have capacity at this time.







Can I get photos or video of deep-sea animals?

While the primary purpose of MBARI’s images and video is scientific research, we do make these assets available for education and outreach. Unfortunately, we don’t have the resources to provide photos or video footage for projects that aren’t specifically about our research. However, we do have a selection of images of deep-sea animals available for use under Creative Commons license. To request additional images or videos, please submit a Media Request Form. Please do not submit requests by phone or email. Requests are reviewed in the order in which they were submitted—additional outreach will not expedite a reply.

Can my production company arrange for a location shoot at MBARI for a story relating to your research?

MBARI is able to support a limited number of requests for location shoots for projects specifically about the institute and our research. Because location shoots can be complicated, we require at least three weeks advance notice, and additional time may be required to coordinate shoots aboard our research vessels. Please review the location shoot guidelines before contacting our communications team. To request a location shoot at MBARI, please complete our online Media Request Form.
