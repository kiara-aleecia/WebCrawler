You can learn a lot by studying the same patch of seafloor for thirty years! ‚Å†üîç‚Å†‚Å†MBARI‚Äôs research site, Station M, is located 4,000 meters (2.5 miles) below the ocean‚Äôs surface and 290 kilometers (180 miles) off the coast of central California. Station M is the only deep-sea site in the world where scientists have conducted long-term, continuous measurements of both the supply of carbon to the seafloor and the consumption of this organic carbon by deep-sea animals and microbes. Read more about Station M on our website.

That Monday morning feeling #notmovinguntilfridayThe shortspine thornyhead rockfish, Sebastolobus alascanus, is found throughout the northeastern Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea to Baja California to depths up to about 1,500 meters (about 4,900 feet). Like other rockfishes, this species grows slowly and may live as long as 80 to 100 years! It can reach lengths of up to 80 centimeters (2.62 feet).¬†Thornyheads are demersal, which means they live on or near the seafloor. We usually find them patiently waiting for their next prey item to appear‚Äîwhich can include shrimp, crabs, zooplankton, amphipods, and other benthic invertebrates.‚Å†

This jelly-like animal fishes for its meals.Siphonophores are close cousins of jellies. They‚Äôre fragile creatures composed of individual, specialized parts connected to each other in a chain. Some parts pulse and steer the colony, others stun and ingest prey. Siphonophores thrive in the midwater where there aren‚Äôt any sharp surfaces to damage their delicate bodies. MBARI‚Äôs remotely operated vehicles, or ROVs, have revealed a surprising diversity of siphonophores in Monterey Bay and we‚Äôve learned they‚Äôre important predators in the ocean‚Äôs depths.We‚Äôve discovered several remarkable new siphonophore species, including this especially cunning predator‚Äîthe angler siphonophore, Erenna sirena. In a dazzling display of predatory prowess, it dangles luminescent lures that mimic crimson crustaceans and attract unsuspecting fishes. Zap! When a curious lanternfish gets too close, the siphonophore‚Äôs tentacles deliver a powerful sting and snare a meal.

Meet a deep-sea escape artist.‚Å†‚Å†When danger approaches, the silky jelly, Colobonema sericeum, uses speed and clever tricks to avoid being eaten. As they make a quick exit, they drop sticky tentacles to confuse potential predators.¬†We have seen silky jellies with tentacles of varying, uneven lengths. This suggests that Colobonema can grow back their lost tentacles.‚Å† Silky jellies are abundant in Monterey Bay, but only between 200‚Äì700 meters (660‚Äì2,300 feet).

‚Å†

We have recorded an extensive archive of deep-sea video that offers insight into more than just animal behavior. Our researchers use this trove of data to understand long-term trends in populations of midwater animals. Comparing thousands of observations of deep-sea jellies reveals how their populations ebb and flow over time. 

¬†During warm El Ni√±o events, they become scarce. As climate change alters the ocean, what will the future look like for Colobonema? We worry they will get squeezed into a smaller and smaller range.‚Å†Animals of the deep have built remarkable strategies to thrive in the ocean. But even an escape artist like Colobonema cannot outrun the impacts of climate change. We must act quickly to ensure the future of these denizens of the deep. Understanding how our actions affect the ocean and Earth‚Äôs climate is critical. Share what you have learned and help us grow our community of ocean champions.‚Å† Learn more about these delicate drifters on our website.

This jelly is ear-resistable!ALTIn the lunar calendar, we‚Äôve entered the Year of the Rabbit‚Äîa time of hope, peace, and prosperity. If you hop into the ocean looking for some bunny to love, you‚Äôre in luck! There are huge algae-eating California sea hares that release magenta ink when they‚Äôre disturbed and cute black-and-white sea bunny nudibranchs that feast on sponges.Our new favorite? The rabbit-ear comb jelly (Kiyohimea usagi), a delicate deep-sea ctenophore that lives in Monterey Bay! Scientists named it usagi‚ÄîJapanese for ‚Äúrabbit"‚Äîbecause little projections on its body look like rabbit ears.‚Å† Want to learn a hare more about the rabbit-ear comb jelly? Check out this video from @mbari-blog! https://mbayaq.co/3Y4itfJ

It‚Äôs been a while since we supplied some serious squeee!‚Å† ü•∞ü§ó‚Å†
‚Å†¬†Also known as the tadpole snailfish, the scientific name for this species, Nectoliparis comes from the Greek words nekton (meaning swimmer) and liparos (meaning fat). This tiny snailfish was captured on camera by the ROV Doc Ricketts at 575 meters (nearly 1,890 feet) deep. Adults of this species only grow to a length of up to 6.5 centimeters (just about three inches) and have been observed as deep as 3,383 meters (nearly 11,100 feet).

Rattail fish are very curious and will investigate any disturbance on or around the seafloor. Those enormous eyes give the rattail an edge. They can glimpse even the faintest flickers of bioluminescence‚Äîthe ‚Äúliving light‚Äù produced by deep-sea animals. Keen eyesight reveals prey, like fishes and squid, darting in the waters above the seafloor.¬†A rattail relies on other senses, like smell and touch, to find a meal too. These fish have a nose for rotting carrion, and sensitive barbels on their chin detect small crustaceans or worms wiggling in the mud below. They can also communicate with a swim bladder that makes a drumming sound. Learn more about the remarkable rattail: https://www.mbari.org/animal/rattail-fish/.

The big red jelly, Tiburonia granrojo,¬†is one of MBARI‚Äôs biggest discoveries, literally.At one meter (about three feet) in diameter, a big red jelly is too big to collect to study in the laboratory. Instead, MBARI‚Äôs video observations have been invaluable in building our understanding of this species.Unlike most jellies, the big red jelly doesn‚Äôt trail thin tentacles behind its bell. Instead, it has four to seven fleshy oral arms that dangle below to help capture food.¬†Batteries of stinging nematocysts cover the surface of these jellies. Their tiny harpoon-like cells stun prey‚Äîthough we‚Äôre still not sure what this species eats.Historically, scientists had to rely on trawl nets to sample the deep sea, but delicate jellies turn to mush when they‚Äôre dragged up to the surface in a net. Robotic submersibles have allowed MBARI researchers to observe these fragile creatures in their natural environment and document the stunning diversity of gelatinous animals in the deep sea. Learn more about these remarkable residents of the deep on our website.

The most terrifying thing in the deep sea. üò±‚Å†‚Å†The human imprint of pollution is now evident in all marine ecosystems, including the deepest parts of our ocean. The impacts of deep-sea trash are magnified by the near-freezing water, lack of sunlight, and low oxygen concentrations that discourage the growth of bacteria and other organisms that can break down debris. Under these conditions, our garbage might persist for decades.
