Know Your Ocean

The ocean covers 70 percent of Earth’s surface and plays a vital role in the health of our planet. MBARI is advancing science and technology to study a changing ocean—from atoms to ecosystems. What we learn will inform and inspire ocean conservation, and make ocean research more accessible to all.
